	<p class="box3">..and I'm studying Computer science at Griffith college Cork. Here is a little about myself: I was born in Ireland but my parents are from Algeria. I've lived in Ireland for 17 years and went through 2 levels of education, Primary and Secondary schools. I also like video games(Rainbow six siege) I have a taste in jazz music and my favourite instrument is the saxophone. I chose computer science due to the history that my family had with technology and myself having interest in computers. My ambition is to learn and master the basics of computer science with the help of my classmates, lecturers and hope to also get acquainted well with them. I am eager to get to know my classmates and lecturers and looking forward to working with them throughout the coming years. I attended Scoil Barra, Ballincollig and completed 1st-6th class from 2006-2014. After that I went to a secondary school called Ballincollig Community School and did only 1st-3rd year from 2014-2017 and In order for me to skip 4th Year(Transition Year) I had to change school and attend Cholaiste Chriost Ri and did 5th-6th year from 2017-2018 and completed my Leaving Certificate.</p>
