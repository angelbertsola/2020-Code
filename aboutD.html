        <p>For the group assignment, which we named “Explore” it is a representation of our respected countries and our attractions. I designed the home page which is a video showcasing the three different countries and how unique each one is.The three countries are buttons which when clicked upon allows the user to enter their country of choice.I made the contact us and the about developers’ pages, the contact us page includes a form which can check for validity.I particpated in zoom calls where my teammates and I brainstormed, I feel that they were extremely helpful as they lead to the progression of our project. </p>

        <p>The work that I carried was that I created the Ireland page which gives a lot of information about Ireland and various information concerning touristic attractions. I also came up with the name of the Website which is called "Explore". Lastly, I took up the job of doing most of the analysis document. I played my part in these objectives.</p>

        <p>I came up with the idea about what the assignment should be about. I wanted to make a travel website since members of our group are from different countries, even different continents, we decided to make a travel website about each one of our countries. While determining the name for the site, I suggested the name “Explore” on which everyone in the team agreed upon. I participated in zoom lectures conducted by teammates and discussed on how should represent our countries for example the topics that needed to be covered and how we should deliver the project. My major role was to make my country Nepal</p>
