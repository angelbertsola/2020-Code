<h2>THE PEOPLE</h2>
<div class="center">

</div>	
<p>Another highlight of Botswana is its people. Batswana are a mesh of many different tribes with unique origins and beliefs. The dominant group is Tswana (79%) whose language Setswana (or Tswana) is the spoken by 90 % of Batswana. The Tswana have a deeply entrenched system of chieftainship and a rich cultural heritage rooted in deep traditional values, reflected in proverbs such as “we are people because of other people”.</p>

<p>The first inhabitants of Botswana were the Basarwa (3%) (Often know as San Bushmen). The traditional Basarwa lifestyle of hunter gathering has sadly diminished over the years with the historic homelands of the Basarwa replaced by National Parks and towns. Basarwa people, who can further be divided into several groups with distinct ‘click’ languages, are no longer able to live the traditional nomadic life of their ancestors. Walking with bushmen is a fascinating activity that attracts visitors over and again to regions like the Central Kalahari and the Makgadikgadi salt pans. The baYei are another very interesting tribal group who arrived in the Okavango region from the Barostse floodlands of the Zambezi and lived in harmony with the Basarwa (known as Bukakhwe in the area). The baYei introduced the ‘mokoro’ dugout canoe, still used widely today as a way of transport and for fishing along the delta channels from village to village.</p>

<h2>Baherero culture unites Botswana,Namibia</h2>

<br>

<image src ="Images/herero-people-namibia-ruro.jpg"style="width:100%">


<br>	
<p>The Baherero Otjiserandu cultural commemorations have been hailed for uniting Botswana and Namibia.

The annual cultural event, which is commemorated in both countries, also paid tribute to the Baherero forefathers.

Tsau in Ngamiland District holds a significant part of the Herero history since some Herero war veterans were buried in the village.

It is against this background  that the Baherero from the two countries gathered in Tsau to honour their forefathers and celebrate their culture.

The second day of Otjiserandu was designated to visit the graves of their forefathers.

The councillor for Tsau, Gaokgakala Letswee urged attendants to develop the open space where the annual event was hosted to a cultural village, which would benefit not only the Baherero but the entire Tsau.

He also appealed to Baherero to ensure the Otjiserandu commemorations attracted many people regardless of ethnicity.

Letswee appreciated  Baherero chief from Namibia and his delegation for honouring the event.

Dr Uhungirua Marenga, Otjiserandu general secretary from Namibia, who is also a university lecturer, said the event cemented the relationship between the Namibian and Botswana Herero descendants.- By Kedirebofe Pelontle.</p>

<br>
<h2>Languages in botswana</h2>
<p>The national language of Botswana is SeTswana, spoken by the Tswana people in the region, while English is recognised as a second official language and is spoken widely throughout the country. People in remote and rural areas that are not frequently visited by tourists are not likely to speak English well, so some basic SeTswana will go a long way in terms of communicating here. There are also about 20 unofficial dialects spoken by people belonging to less dominant tribal groups, such as Hambukushu, Seyei, Herero, and Kalanga, while only about five of the original 13 Bushman dialects remain, known collectively as SeSarwa.The local currency is pula and it is also the country’s motto and rallying cry (in this context it means ‘shield’), and is shouted out by crowds at football matches whenever the national team, ‘The Zebras’, scores a goal.</p>

<h2>Food in Botswana</h2>
<div class="center">
	<image src ="Images/Botswana_food.jpg"width ="500" height ="375" alt="zzz" title ="zzz">
</div>		
<p>Safari lodges and camps in Botswana serve an array of internationally recognised food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and dietary requirements can be catered for with ease when given prior notice. Beef and chicken are popular meats eaten locally and served many ways in restaurants and in the dining rooms at lodges, so travellers can expect to enjoy food they know when being catered for in the country.
<br>
Local dishes include beef seswaa, bogobe (pap), and morogo, which are eaten throughout Botswana and surrounding countries. Beef seswaa is slow cooked beef (usually fillet), which is then shredded and cooked as a pot stew with an onion and pepper gravy. Bogobe, is ground cornmeal boiled with water and salt until it becomes a porridge-like consistency and is then served as the starch with meat and veg. Bogobe is often accompanied by a tomato and onion relish, or cooked spinach in a dish known as morogo. Meat is also traditionally grilled on open coals, as are large, white mielies (corn on the cob), which are farmed on a small, subsistence level. These are seen often on the roadside where vendors are set up with their grills serving the passing local public. The local beer is a St. Louis, and it goes down a treat!
<br>
Tipping practice in Botswana can be compared to anywhere else in Africa. A general guideline for tipping servers at restaurants is to add 10% of one’s bill as a gratuity if one feels they received a good standard of service; however, as always, this amount is at the client’s discretion. When it comes to tipping one’s safari guide, a standardised approach is to tip an amount of 10% of the daily rate per person per day, and to pay it directly to one’s guide at the end of the stay. It is encouraged to show gratitude after an excellent safari experience by tipping well in either Pula, or the guest’s home currency. Housekeeping and kitchen staff, as well as back up guides, mokoro pollers, and boat drivers are also eligible for tips and there is often a deposit box for staff tips, while individual tips should be paid to the individuals themselves.

<h2>The Art in Botswana</h2>
<br>
<p>Designs have long been painted on houses in Botswana, according to "Culture and Customs of Botswana." The designs include depictions of animals, flowers, playing card motifs (clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades), as well as lekgapho, a square decorated with grooved wavy lines made by dragging the fingers through cow dung. The painting of houses appears to be a dying practice, although commercial building still are commonly decorated with painted designs. The artists who decorate their houses with these designs typically are women, and their designs often re aabstract expressions of creativity.</p>

<h2>The Tradional baskets</h2>
<br>
<p>The traditional baskets of Botswana are made of leaves from a fan palm called mokolwane, according to Botswana Tourism. The cut leaves are boiled in a natural earth-tone dye, and basketmakers use the lemao, a sharpened wire with a wooden handle, to insert and wrap the leaf in the coil of the basket. Nature-inspired designs often are incorporated into the baskets, which are noted for their quality and originality. Most baskets in the country are made in the northwest and are regarded as some of the finest baskets made in Africa. They are sold internationally as well as domestically.</p>
