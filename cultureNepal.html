            <p><img class="imgri" src="Images/Holi-Nepal.jpg" alt="Holi Celebration" title="Holi" >Customs and traditions differ from one part of Nepal to another. A conglomeration lies in capital city Kathmandu where cultures are blending to form a national identity. Kathmandu Valley has served as the country’s cultural metropolis since the unification of Nepal in the 18th Century. A prominent factor in a Nepali’s everyday life is religion. Adding color to the lives of Nepalis are festivals the year round which they celebrate with much pomp and joy. Food plays an important role in the celebration of these festivals.<img src="Images/Namaste.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="Namaste" title="Nepali girl-Namaste" style="float: left"></p>

            <p><img class="imgle" src="Images/Durbar%20Square.jpg" alt="Durbar Square" title="Durbar Square" >Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. At the heart of the old city’s mazelike alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic during Indra Jatra, a religious festival featuring masked dances. Many of the city's historic sites were damaged or destroyed by a 2015 earthquake. Durbar Square's palace, Hanuman Dhoka, and Kasthamandap, a wooden Hindu temple, are being rebuilt.
            The square's Maju Deval, a pagoda known for its steep stairs, is also being rebuilt. The city’s other notable religious sites being rebuilt include Swayambhunath, a Buddhist temple known as the “Monkey Temple” for its main inhabitants, and Boudhanath, a massive Buddhist stupa. Pashupatinath, a Hindu temple dating to the 1400s, survived the earthquake. South of the Bagmati River is the city of Patan, renowned for metalsmithing and other crafts, and home to the Patan Museum, housing Hindu, Buddhist and Tantric artifacts.</p>

        <h2>Festivals</h2>
        <p>The people of Nepal keep their culture and traditions close to their heart. The age-old religious practices are still followed along with the modern trends that are developing here. If you are the kind of traveller who loves to closely know the place you visit, then festivals are the best opportunity you have. Here is a list of major festivals during which you can enjoy both – your Nepal holidays and festivals, and return with an highly enriching experience.</p>

            <p> Nepalese dishes are generally healthier than most other South Asian cuisine, relying less on using fats and more on chunky vegetables, lean meats, pickled ingredients and salads. However, Nepal does take heavy influences from its closest geographical companions such as India, China and Tibet.Common ingredients found across Nepalese cuisine include lentils, potatoes (which are particularly popular within the Newar communities in the Himalayas and Pahar region), tomatoes, cumin, coriander, chilies, peppers, garlic and mustard oil.</p>

            <div id="1" style="display: none" "background-color: #FFFACD">
            <p>Due to farming restrictions in some of the higher regions of Nepal, rice is often substituted with other grains, such as cornmeal and barley, in addition to potatoes, unleavened breads and dhido (a porridge-like consistency, made using flour and hot water). This is most obvious when looking at the indisputably popular dish, Dal Bhat. If Nepal had a national dish, this would be it. Having crossed the border from Bengal, Dal Bhat consists of a rice (or substitute) centre, alongside lentils which are surrounded by various different dishes. </p>

            <div id="2" style="display: none;"><p><b>Momo</b> are Nepal’s version of dumplings, and usually contain steamed vegetables or meat. Momo are usually accompanied by one or two dips, often with a tomato base or fermented vegetables. Condiments in Nepal are sometimes quite spicy, and often contain raw chili and garlic. Similar to the Gyoza found in Japan, momo are also consumed in parts of India, Bhutan and Tibet, and are a very popular snack.</p>

        <p><b>Thukpa</b> is a Nepalese hot noodle soup, containing pieces of meat and vegetables. This wintry delicacy is popular in Kathmandu and other mountainous regions of Nepal, being a warming and comforting dish. Meaning ‘noodle’ in Tibetan, Thukpa takes influences from both Tibet and China, and is often seen eaten alongside momo. The carefully seasoned meat stock gives the dish a very pleasant aroma, meat toppings reflect the fauna of Nepal, and can range from yak, goat, and lamb to chicken.</p>
