<h2>Why Botswana</h2>
<image src ="Images/Twisted-tree-in-the-Tuli-Botswana-Africa-Enchanting-Travels.jpg"width ="1440" height ="800" alt="zzz" title ="zzz">	
<p>Botswana’s primary attraction is its vast wilderness. From the endless palm-covered islands of the Okavango Delta, to the moonscape saltpans of the Makgadikgadi region, it’s the perfect destination for anyone seeking pristine, unfenced surroundings.
<br>
Botswana’s commitment to safeguarding its wildlife heritage is unparalleled in Africa. The country covers a total area of 581,730 sq km, and approximately 40% of this land falls within a wildlife-protected area. These areas are a sanctuary for the world’s largest concentration of elephant, and a stronghold for other endangered large mammals such as the black rhinoceros, African wild dog, cheetah and lion. For avian enthusiasts, there exists no better place in the world to view the Slaty Egret and Wattled Crane, and seeing the illusive Pels Fishing Owl for the first time has been known to bring bird-watchers to tears!
 <br>
In 2014, Botswana consolidated its position as a conservation leader by banning commercial hunting, paving the way for former hunting areas to be transformed into photographic safari destinations. The government’s decision to opt for a high-quality, low-impact tourism model means that safari-goers can generally avoid congested game drives, especially when staying in one of the many privately operated concessions, which commonly have their visitor density limited to around one guest per 50 sq km. These concessions, licensed out to top safari companies, boast some of the most luxurious yet eco-conscious lodges and camps in Africa. In order to lease the land, lodge owners must show commitment to uplifting local communities by providing jobs for people in close proximity to concession boundaries. Today wildlife and tourism employs around 45% of adults in Botswana, making it the country’s’ second largest income earner after diamonds.
<br>
Travellers can feel secure in the knowledge that Botswana is one of Africa’s most stable and peaceful nations, with the continent’s longest continuous multi-party democracy and a steady economy.Botswana is a safari destination that boasts outstanding wildlife density and variety, and it is wild and organic without fences and developed tourist facilities. In this sense, it attracts adventurous travellers who are passionate about nature and wildlife experiences and who are not nervous in the presence of wild animals. Keen photographers would benefit greatly from a Botswana holiday at different times of the year, as varying locations offer unique and interesting natural scenery, not to mention superb wildlife activity to capture.
</p>

<h2>The Okavango Delta</h2>
<p>Considered as one of the seven natural wonders of Africa, the Okavango Delta is a jewel in Botswana’s crown.  

One of the reasons this phenomena occurs is due to yearly flooding of the Okavango River which sees vast amounts of rainwater reaching the Delta from Angola.

This large amount of water concurs in relation to Botswana’s arid season which results in excessive relocation of wildlife from other dryer areas because of the time of year.</p>

<h2>Experience the ancient San paintings at Tsodilo Hills</h2>
<p>It’s believed that people have inhabited the area of Tsodilo Hills for around 100 000 years. This makes it one of the planet's most ancient historical sites and a must-see location for anyone visiting Botswana.  

The main attractions are the cryptic rock paintings, which have captured the imagination of explorers for decades. There is also a museum where camping facilities are available as well as trails and walks and roughly 500 locations where the paintings of San people can be found.</p>

<h2>A vast array of wildlife at the Chobe National Park</h2>
<br>
<p>It’s said that the Chobe National park has some of the largest numbers and widest variety of wildlife in all of Africa. Chobe is famous for its dense concentration of elephants which amount to roughly 50,000 one of the largest amounts in the world.The Kalahari Desert which covers most of Botswana is unique in that it supports a variety of wildlife and a vast collection of fauna and flora including the Acacia tree as well as 500 other species of plants.</p>

<h2>Tuli Block – land of giants</h2>
<br>
<p>Located beside the southeastern border near South Africa on the iconic Limpopo River is the Tuli Block which has aptly been described as ‘The Land of giants’ and is a rare treat for any wildlife enthusiast.The reserve has an accessible vantage point to watch animals ensuring that one is assured to see various types of game. Some of the wildlife on offer includes 350 recorded bird species, waterbuck, eland, elephant, cheetah, lion and leopard. Caracal, aardwolf, hyena and jackals which can only be seen after dark.</p>

<h2>The wild dogs of the Moremi Game Reserve</h2>
<p>It’s believed that Botswana is the country with 30% of the world’s wild dog population. With numbers dwindling over recent years for various reasons it’s safe to say that this definitely another valid reason to choose Botswana for your next African safari.The area is unfenced and is away from farming communities making it the ideal location for the dogs to exist in their natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Wildlife in Botswana.</h2>
<p>The wilds of Northern Botswana safeguard the largest elephant population in the world. Huge breeding herds and large solitary bulls traverse the landscapes of Chobe National Park and Moremi Game Reserve. Chobe’s broad-leaved woodlands and riparian forests are home to the endemic Chobe bushbuck and other lesser-known antelope species like puku, sable and roan. Chobe also boasts the highest bird species diversity in Botswana (468 species), including birds found nowhere else in the country like the Schalow’s and Purple-crested turacos, Trumpeter and Crowned hornbills and the Crested guinea fowl.
<br>
Savute, in the western Chobe region is notorious for its large lion prides, historically numbering up to 30-odd individuals. The unpredictability of Savuti’s water supply has been known to set the scene for dramatic feats of survival, including hibernating crocodiles and bold lions preying on adult elephants. Savuti’s vast savanna plains are perfect for enjoying sightings of Burchell’s zebra, tsessebe, giraffe, and impala.
<br>
Red lechwe splashing through the swamplands, hippopotamuses trodding confidently out of water at midday and lions swimming across water channels are just a few of the spectacular wildlife sightings awaiting visitors to the Okavango Delta. The Okavango comes into its own during winter months when rainwater from the highlands of Angola fans out over temporary floodplains that teem with wildlife. You could get lucky and spot a semi-aquatic sitatunga antelope from a mokoro, lurking in the papyrus – or a Pels Fishing Owls. These beautiful owls replace their daylight rivals, fish eagles, on perches overlooking deep lagoons where they fish for large bream. The Delta is also the best place to see the near-endemic Slaty Egret, Wattled Crane, and special waterbirds such as the Lesser Jacana, White-backed night heron and African skimmer.</p>

<h2>Big Cat Safaris in Botswana</h2>
<br>
<p>A Botswana safari is perfect for seeing big cats - Moremi National Park is one of Africa’s best location for lions, leopards and cheetahs, at any time of the year.

However, If you’re looking for larger pride of lion, you’ll love Duba Plains - further north the Linyanti Concession and Chobe National Park are also excellent for finding elusive cats such as leopards. Lebala Camp is also a habitat for cheetahs and leopards.

During the dry season, several camps in Botswana offer walking safaris - giving you the excitement of tracking cats on foot, from a safe distance. Here are 10 reasons why you need to go on a big cat safari in Botswana</p>
